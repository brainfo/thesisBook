Welcome! 

This is a toy benchmarking for [scverse](https://scverse.org/) and [bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) community (or cross them) to analyze 10x single nuclei RNA-seq data. 

This is from the main project of my PhD work.

From my current experience:

- bioconductor has more solid basement of biological (annotation) data
- questions and methods to tackle them (except for dl) are usually first developmed in R, then the python community would propose competing methods. Since seruat comes earlier than scanpy
- the scanpy community evolves fast but somehow the developers are not considering better integrating each other's new features
- packages in R is in general easier to use, though I personally is more used to python and could adapt more myself
